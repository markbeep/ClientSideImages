## Cursed Image Storing Methods

https://images.markc.su/

Quick and fun website to demonstrate some cursed ways to store user images without actually having to store them locally.

## PRs welcome

Have a ~~cursed~~ cool method you wanna add on? Just create a new page and open a pull request.
This is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) website, so every new `page.tsx` in the `app/` directory automatically turns into a new page.

## Development

To develop locally, all you need is yarn:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```
